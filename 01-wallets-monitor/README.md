# Build Your Wallet Signal Monitoring System: Track 100K Solana Wallets at Zero Cost  

As an on-chain trader, I’ve tried many wallet-tracking tools but found them lacking. Most can’t track more than 300 wallets, far from enough. So I built a powerful signal monitoring system that can theoretically track 100K wallets and process 500K transactions per month.  

To filter noise and extract real alpha, I integrated market cap and other filters based on my trading strategies. I also used DeepSeek to auto summarize related tweets. Now, trading feels much smoother.  

The entire system runs at near zero cost using:  
- **Helius Webhooks** for wallet activity tracking  
- **Vercel API routes** to deploy the server  
- **Supabase** for storage and real-time WebSocket transaction monitoring  
- **Shyft** to parse transactions Helius can't, like Pumpfun and Metaora pools  
- **DeepSeek** for automatic tweet summaries  
- **Telegram Bot** to send trading signals
